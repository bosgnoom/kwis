# kwis
Single serve Kahoot clone. To be used in an offline application. Very alpha stage. 

Just to learn a bit about meteor and how to use git...

Do not use for real life applications!

Oh yeah... Sorry for the half English/half Dutch...


How to use/install:

Install meteor
Create meteor app (meteor create kwis)
Clone this repo into the same directory
Run app (meteor run)

Meteor packages needed:
- session
- reactive-var
- accounts-password (not used)
- random
- ... (forgot, will be added in some time...)
- msavin:mongol (for testing)
